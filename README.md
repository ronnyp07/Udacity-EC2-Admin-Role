# PROJECT SPECIFICATION:

## Project Introduction

You will create an EC2 Instance based on Amazon Linux AMI that you can connect via SSH. While provisioning the instance, you will make sure to limit access to your IP address only, using Security Groups. The instance will already have the CLI installed by default. You just need to assign permissions to this instance.

Once the instance is running, create an IAM role with admin access to your account. Then, attach the role to your EC2. In this case, the CLI tool will pick up the credentials from the role and wonâ€™t need hard-coded credentials.

## Exercise objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

Launch a secure EC2 instance

- Create IAM role with admin privileges
- Attach the IAM role to the EC2 instance created earlier
- Connect to your EC2 instance via SSH
- Use CLI tool in the EC2 instance
